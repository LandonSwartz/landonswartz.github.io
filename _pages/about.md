## Welcome

Hello! This is my personal website, blog, and way to host various publications. I am currently a first-year computer science graduate student. My research focus is on computer vision; or the ways and math that computers see and interpret the world. Feel free to connect me in any of the ways provided if you have questions about my work or ideas to bounce.

Soli Deo Gloria
