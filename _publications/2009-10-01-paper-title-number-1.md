Abstract: The first draft of the Arabidopsis genome was released more than 20 years ago and despite intensive molecular research, more than 30% of Arabidopsis genes remained uncharacterized or without an assigned function. This is in part due to gene redundancy within gene families or the essential nature of genes, where their deletion results in lethality (i.e., the dark genome). High-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) offers an automated and unbiased approach to characterize subtle or transient phenotypes resulting from gene redundancy or inducible gene silencing; however, access to commercial HTPP platforms remains limited. Here we describe the design and implementation of OPEN leaf, an open-source phenotyping system with cloud connectivity and remote bilateral communication to facilitate data collection, sharing and processing. OPEN leaf, coupled with our SMART imaging processing pipeline was able to consistently document and quantify dynamic changes at the whole rosette level and leaf-specific resolution when plants experienced changes in nutrient availability. Our data also demonstrate that VIS sensors remain underutilized and can be used in high-throughput screens to identify and characterize previously unidentified phenotypes in a leaf-specific time-dependent manner. Moreover, the modular and open-source design of OPEN leaf allows seamless integration of additional sensors based on users and experimental needs.
