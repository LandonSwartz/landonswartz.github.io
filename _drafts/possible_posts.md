0. Homography Estimation and Evaluation
1. Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression
    - Can look into the several types of ANMS
        - MOPS paper version with robustness and radius
        - efficient local max and 10% higher than neighbors
        - ANMS codes on github version
2. Subpixel accuracy for harris corner
    - https://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2018/229/article_lr.pdf
3. Multi-scale detection and different NMS and different corner responses
    - https://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2018/229/article_lr.pdf
4. Different NMS and different corner responses
    - use many corner response from harris paper and thresholding of response matrix
    - use different NMS strategies
5. SIFT
6. SURF
