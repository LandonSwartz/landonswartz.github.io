# Optimizating the Harris Corner Detector
## Brief Introduction
One of the reasons that I started this blog was to start doing project-based learning on computer vision concepts outside of my graduate classes. That was why I chose the Harris Corner Detector as one of my first posts - it was one of the first projects in my Computer Vision graduate class. But that lead me into one of the greatest problems of project-based learning outside of the classroom. After a class project, one moves on to new work with little regard for state of the project they just did. But, as I found with this project, that mentality doesn't always translate to the real world.
