# Optimizating the Harris Corner Detector

## Brief Introduction

One of the reasons that I started this blog was to start doing project-based learning on computer vision concepts outside of my graduate classes. That was why I chose the Harris Corner Detector as one of my first posts - it was one of the first projects in my Computer Vision graduate class. But that lead me into one of the greatest problems of project-based learning outside of the classroom. After a class project, one moves on to new work with little regard for state of the project they just did. But, as I found with this project, that mentality doesn't always translate to the real world. 

The corner detector we implemented in the last posts was, at the time, not too far off from being a finished product. It was quite similar to my original implementation I submitted. But then I started working on implement feature descriptors and matching them. It was a long time, like a REALLY long time. That is what led to this blog post. This post is all about optimizating through vectorizing, parallelization, and generally smarter ways to implement things. It was a great learning experience for learning that a project is never truly finished but just reaches steps of maturity.
